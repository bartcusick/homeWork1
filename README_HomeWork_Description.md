# Bart CUsick's first BootCamp Homework assignment - 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

I tried to take existing code and refactor it to either meet accessability standards. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

I hope i left the code a little cleaner than I found it.
